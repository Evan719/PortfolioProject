    Here are a few of my recent projects and aspirations.<br>

                I've been an Assistant Stage Manager for Baruch Gayton Entertainment for 8 years.

                <p>I am one who enjoys games. Any kind of game.<br>
                    But my favorite games are the ones that my family and I<br>
                    play around the table on Sunday nights.<br>
                    That's why one of the projects I'm hoping to produce,<br>
                    is a line of AR (Augmented Reality) tabletop games.<br>
                    The options are limitless:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stratego</li>
                    <li>Risk</li>
                    <li>Settlers of Catan</li>
                    <li>Card Games</li>
                    <li>Even Dungeons and Dragons!</li>
                    <br></ul>
                In an age where technology runs our lives,<br>
                I for one would love to see it bring our families back together,<br>
                instead of texting each other in the same room and never speaking.

                <p>I am a very progressive thinking person.<br>
                    What are some of the needs I see,<br>
                    and what can I do to fill them?<br><br>
                    I often drive to places I've never been to,<br>
                    and luckily my phone has navigation.<br>
                    But!<br>
                    There's no good place for me to put my phone while I drive<br>
                    and still be safe while I look at the directions.<br>
                    I either have to put my phone in my cup holder,<br>
                    or on the seat next to me.<br><br>
                    This is where AR (Augmented Reality) comes in.<br>
                    Using Google Maps and a special pane loaded into your windshield<br>
                    You're able to view your directions<br>
                    in a safe and comfortable method,<br>
                    while still being able to keep your eyes perfectly on the road.<br></p>

                <p>One of the projects I am hoping to accomplish<br>
                    is an AR (Augmented Reality) app for identifying plants.<br><br>
                    All too often I have been hiking or even just walking<br>
                    in my own neighborhood, and seen a tree or flower<br>
                    that I thought was just so beautiful,<br>
                    and I wanted to know more about it.<br>
                    But how do I Google this tree?<br>
                    How is Yahoo supposed to know what flower I found behind my house?<br>
                    Exactly.<br><br>
                    So not only would this app identify the plant,<br>
                    but it would also tell you where it is indigenous<br>
                    and some common uses and facts about it.</p></td>
